# systemd
a Systemd alternative

What?
-----

There's this cool new project in the linux world called "systemd" that's supposed to replace init.d-scripts and thereby simplify system configuration.

Why?
----

IMO systemd is somewhat bloated. So I want to create an alternative that is similar in functionality but less bloated.

How?
----

Simple: you simply write a YAML configuration file about how you want the system to look like, and my software will make it run.
